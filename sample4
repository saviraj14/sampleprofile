<!--Your Task:

You are provided with an HTML file that contains a div element with the class name box.

Your task is to ensure that the box element is styled correctly using the following box model properties:

Width: Set the width of the box to 200px.

Padding: Apply padding of 20px to create space between the content and the border.

Border: Add a solid black border with a width of 5px.

Margin: Include a margin of 15px around the box to separate it from other elements.

Background color: Set the background color of the box to lightblue.

You will run a series of tests to verify that these properties are applied correctly. The tests will check the following:

The width of the box.

The padding inside the box.

The border around the box.

The margin around the box.

The background color of the box.-->
